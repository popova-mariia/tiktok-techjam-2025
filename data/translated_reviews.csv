Haci'nin Yeri - Yigit Lokantasi,,Gulsum Akar,,We went to Marmaris with my wife for a holiday. We chose this restaurant as a place for dinner based on the reviews and because we wanted juicy food. When we first went there was a serious queue. You proceed by taking the food you want in the form of an open buffet. Both vegetable dishes and meat dishes were plentiful. There was also dessert for those who wanted it. After you get what you want you pay at the cashier. They don't go through cards they work in cash. There was a lot of food variety. And the food prices were unbelievably cheap. We paid only 84 TL for all the meals here. It included buttermilk and bread. But unfortunately I can't say it's too clean as a place..
Haci'nin Yeri - Yigit Lokantasi,,Oguzhan Cetin,,During my holiday in Marmaris we ate here to fit the food. It's really good that the food is cheap and nice.

On July 1 there was a small increase but even the price hike is cheap. I leave the photo of the latest prices and breakfast below. there was a serious queue.

Vefa Bozacisi,,Selcuk Polat,,The number of tables is very small; but no problem; the taste was very good.
Vefa Bozacisi,,Cigdem Kutlu,,Perfect!
Vefa Bozacisi,,Berkay Genc,,I don't understand what kind of business it is to sell boza in a foam glass. Offering chickpeas is a tradition next to the spoiler; but in Vefa you have to go and buy it yourself from the shop on the opposite side.
Vefa Bozacisi,,Muhammed Duman,,Vefa Bozacisi must be the most beautiful place that comes to mind when Boza is mentioned. The groceries are quite affordable.
Vefa Bozacisi,,Merve Ayda,,It is a flavor that can be tried when you go to Istanbul.

Salacak,,Muhammed Bayalan,,Great.
Salacak,,Nur Aydin,,Ambiance was amazing!

Nusr-et,,Beril Guney,,Prices are so high..
Nusr-et,,Emrah Yildirim,,I do not recommend the lamb cage at all. But skewered and tenderloin are great. My carrot slice isn't bad. The waiters are interested and polite; but there are difficulties in understanding the order. You would like it cooked well; it comes undercooked.
Nusr-et,,Pelin Kaymaz,,We've been here many times and each time we left satisfied; Lokum meat; spaghetti; nusret hamburger; salad with tulum cheese; etc. very good but of course high in price compared to many places.
Nusr-et,,Beyza Yeliz,,It's as if your old meticulousness is gone. The cage arrived cold; the salad came for 1; I said two; I did not drink alcohol; but 6 double raki was written in my account; when I told the waiter; he said are you sure you didn't drink?
Nusr-et,,Necmiye Ataseven,,There is a queue at the door; there are wonderful places in Sarıyer. I came with the force of my friends; the music chosen is similar to the music played in Italian pizzeria.
Nusr-et,,Adem Ince,,He's very successful. Even though it was very crowded; the service was incredibly fast.

Tuana Restaurant,,Engin Firtina,,The presentations are very good; it obviously has a skilled and attentive chef. Fish and squid are fresh.
Tuana Restaurant,,Ahmet Ekim,,DEFINITELY DO NOT COME. We came here for breakfast based on the reviews on the way. We said the breakfast called the village breakfast for 2 people.

Tuana Restaurant,,Korsel Aydogdu,,They bring delicious yoghurt to the dishes; the portions are hearty; with a beautiful view of the lakeside.
Tuana Restaurant,,Erim Kadioglu,,I recommend the handmade hamburger at a good price; reasonable (50TL) and satisfying. Sprinkled village breakfast (125 TL per person) is a weak; ordinary breakfast.
Cici Tantuni,,Ali Kizil,,Tantuni was amazing. We just came here to try it.
Cici Tantuni,,Derin Yilmaz,,In general; it is delicious; you can ask for both wrap and bread. Although the waiting time is around 10 minutes; the red cabbage and pickled peppers served from the front satisfy you.

Bunbun Kas,,Metehan Kilic,,Overall it wasn't bad. It was delicious and ice cold. Mohair meat was delicious. The fries were nice. However; the bread that gives the place its name is a disappointment.
Bunbun Kas,,Selim Sinan,,It has a hearty menu that starts with a very sweet encounter; it was quite delicious; the pepper sauce they made is successful.
Bunbun Kas,,Melisa Eser,,There are many options on the menu and the average portion price is 50 TL. One portion is very satisfying; but if you don't like dough; you've come to the wrong address. They put the ingredients of your choice between a soft steamed bread.
Bunbun Kas,,Ertugrul Ozcan,,I really liked the handmade basil buttermilk and lemonade. The chicken sandwich is okay; I think the chocolate one has nothing to say; it only had strawberries in it; there could be more fruit like waffles.

Nazar Cafe,,Burhan Kilic,,I went with my friends; their milk desserts were very good.

Nazar Cafe,,Berkay Tasdeviren,,We went to eat dessert as a family and we were satisfied. It was a bit crowded.
Nazar Cafe,,Nalan Kavskli,,It's cold and extremely bad; the price of the food is way above its quality; 46 liras for 6 meatballs; 30 minutes or more waiting time. I definitely don't recommend it.
Nazar Cafe,,Alper Kultufan,,Very good quality and expensive also always crowded.
Nazar Cafe,,Kadir Turkoglu,,Good.

Alsancak Firin,,Ozge Askiner,,I ate boyoz for the first time. For me; I guess I wouldn't eat it again. Frankly; it's not a taste that I will look for and miss.
Alsancak Firin,,Safa Oz,,I ate a variety of boyoz for the first time and I liked it very much. The service is fast and the atmosphere is friendly. If you come to Izmir; do not pass by here.

Sushico,,Nilufer Karatas,,It was the best SushiCo restaurant I've experienced. Sushi was perfect and delicious.
Sushico,,Cansel Elcin,,First of all; our orders came very quickly. Edamame came without salt; which we liked a lot. You can add your own. We ordered tuna and salmon as sashimi. I couldn't eat good sashimi in Istanbul for a long time; unfortunately this place did not pass the exam.

Nesh,,Akin Hoca,,The staff is very fast; the waffles are great; I definitely recommend it.

Bilice,,Orhan Uslu,,Service sucks. Customer care is below zero. The view is very good but the place is extremely neglected.
Bilice,,Alperen Ozturk,,It gets very crowded because it's the weekend; we have to go a little early; you may not find a place to eat something
Baruthane Pilavcisi,,Betty Karmen,,It's too plentiful; so I guess the prices are high. But a mixture of so many different dishes was not that good.

Baruthane Pilavcisi,,Selim Ekol,,I ate baruthane kebab with rice; it was very good; a little expensive.

Baruthane Pilavcisi,,Baris Kurt,,It was nice experience; you have to try it.
Baruthane Pilavcisi,,Buse Atay,,250 TL account was received for 1 portion of rice + kuru fasulye + ayran + Cola. Service and waiters are very bad.
Baruthane Pilavcisi,,Emine Uslu,,It's not something to be exaggerated; and people come from out of town just for their rice. The waiters were kind; the environment was clean.
Baruthane Pilavcisi,,Hatice Yildiz,,The flavor is excellent. Roasting meat was like cotton. Price is a little above normal. Location of the restourant was really good.
Baruthane Pilavcisi,,Selim Siner,,There was only 3-4 chickpeas in my rice; it was a bit unsalted. Treats were good. It had a classic rice flavor.
Baruthane Pilavcisi,,Fatih Cicek,,The menu is very nice; the food is legendary; also the waiters were very polite.
Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Erdogan Ozer,,I had high expectations but the kebabs were unsuccessful. Hummus was good. They use quality olive oil.
Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Mahmut Ortakaya,,There was a hair strand in my food! There is no problem in service or interest other than this issue; they give the right to the fee they receive.
Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Serpil Can,,"They have very delicious meat; especially tiny lahmacun, super appetizers; delicious food here. The food is very nice. The workers can be a little more interested. They are very interested in Arab customers. They don't care about us. This situation makes us sad."
Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Sevim Cilingir,,Nice place but the order came very late; the prices are not so high. It can be tried.
Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Ibrahim Kizgin,,"very clean table arrangement is good; waiters are very interested; they look immediately; the order comes without a long wait, the food is really delicious as it is said; it is excellent; I recommend it."

Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Akif Firat,,It is a luxurious place where you can try the delicious tastes of both Turkish and Arabic cuisine.
Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Tacettin Ozguner,,Please review the ticket slip. A business that wants money for the bread on the table; 20 TL for the service fee; 20 TL for the valet.
Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Musab Bakirci,,Unfortunately; the waiters are very uninterested. Since there are too many Arab customers; the attention and interest is more towards them. Stones were found in my food?!
Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Serkan Simsek,,Even though the service is terrible; they ask for a service fee of 144 TL; what a nonsense!
Medeniyetler Sofrasi,,Humeyra Arslan,,Hatay gastronomy house is an excellent place; you should definitely go... Quality and affordable...

Backyard,,Ece Oztunc,,We went for both breakfast and dinner. First of all; it has a very nice environment. When we went for breakfast; we sat inside and one can sit for hours. Its decoration; quiet and nice; being in the trees is very nice. Especially having an open kitchen adds a positive score to the customer.
Backyard,,Busra Kaya,,The place is very beautiful; the food is so delicious; you can go with your pet to one of the rare restaurants that cook the meat to the exact consistency you want. The toilets are not separate for men's and women's toilets so there was a bit of a cleaning problem.
Backyard,,Sebnem Cep,,The service is slow; I think there is a lack of staff and unhappiness; it has not to expensive and it was seedy experience.
Backyard,,Guler Keskec,,Although it was crowded; the ambiance and food of the place was nice. Thank you.
Backyard,,Onur Ediz,,Great place.. Contrary to the comments; the employees were interested.. The hot dog was impressive.. The hamburger was not bad.
Backyard,,Mark Moayad,,Despite the current times; it was a very pleasant visit. They currently don’t take booking; they have a walk-in system where you put your name down and after a short wait they seat you inside. Once inside you can opt to be put on a waitlist to sit outside. The setting is really nice and rustic and the tables are well distanced. There was a nice evening crowd and a good energy in the ambience.
Backyard,,Yusuf Uran,,The service provided was very nice; I was happy.
Backyard,,Ozge Onan,,Smoked salmon salad was average. Colored eggs do not contribute to the taste. Salmon was too salty; fried potatoes were bland.
Backyard,,Viviana Kwon,,Eggs Benedict with pork bacon was nice.
Alavara,,Eylem Dag,,Excellent taste; and the shabbyness of the place was also nice.
Alavara,,Ayse Ozturk,,A full student meal. The price is cheap and the taste is high.
Alavara,,Ediz Aksoy,,It's a place with very affordable and delicious pasta. Actually; there is not much variety of pasta. Classic pasta is served with cheddar cheese and sauce. I think the taste and price of the pasta is very good.
Alavara,,Esin Erdinc,,They serve an uncooked pasta with a tasteless sauce and cheese and some corn. Half portion is 20 TL. It didn't suit my taste.
Alavara,,Caner Senturk,,I think it was pretty cool. The price of a portion of pasta was 22 TL. I highly recommend you go.
Alavara,,Ece Ocak,,classic alavara pasta; if you don't have a tiny little stomach; say it right. Pasta 42 TL price performance product...
Alavara,,Destan Gursoy,,The taste is unbelievably good and satisfying enough; it is also very affordable; but you have a hard time finding an incredibly crowded place.
Alavara,,Safak Uslu,,Not to mention pasta; their sauces are so successful that you can destroy the whole plate without noticing. Also; the dumplings are nice.
Alavara,,Cagri Oner,,Tasty meals.
Alavara,,Sevgi Siner,,It was the most delicious pasta I have ever eaten; thank you.
Alavara,,Hasan Basarir,,Service was fast. I ate ravioli; it was good.
Zula,,Murat Kucukyildiz,,Surprised location; but nice clean venue. The employees are friendly; I don't want to comment on the prices; they were too high..
Zula,,Rabia Kucuk,,In general; I was satisfied; since the hamburger is a little small; it will be more satisfying if the one with a higher grammage is chosen.
Zula,,Deniz Sirp,,Burgers are great hot dogs do. It is very interesting that french fries are 114 TL.
Zula,,Dogukan Yildiz,,Hamburger is really delicious. The fries are normal.
Zula,,Ali Ken,,The best hamburger restaurant in Istanbul. Cooking and sauce is very good.
Zula,,Haluk Kinaci,,Burgers are super. I've eaten hamburgers in many places; but I've never come across anything like this. Fantastic meal with friendly service in a small but cozy place. I strongly recommend.
Zula,,Serdar Candan,,The delicious combination of truffle sauce and burger was legendary.
Zula,,Eray Arslan,,It was one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. The only downside is that the portion is a little small. Apart from that; it is definitely a place to experience.
Zula,,Haldun Yilmaz,,Well prepared hamburger; special taste. But a little bit expensive.here/
Zula,,Kardelen Derin,,It is delicious in everything with its sauce and bread.
Zula,,Erim Gozen,,The taste is good; but it's not worth paying 90 TL for a wet hamburger-sized burger and not even getting fries...
Kafros Pizzeria,,Fatma Ceylan,,They make the pizza in a wood fired stone oven. It's different than any pizza you've experienced before. They use cheddar cheese as cheese. We preferred the 2 and 3 special pizzas.
Kafros Pizzeria,,Yasin Kisa,,I definitely recommend the seasonal kenger pizza. We also loved the sauce in three different olive oils; one with garlic; thyme and hot pepper.
Kafros Pizzeria,,Emine Kaya,,You can't get enough of the thin pizza dough. Overcrowded employees are very concerned. We ate pizza at Mia highly recommend.
Kafros Pizzeria,,Tugay Sari,,Staff were quick but surly. the service was actually fast; i can't afford it. We ordered chicken and mushroom pizza; its taste was normal; the dough was very thin and it wasn't burnt; which was the only good thing. Coming to the wage issue; there were prices that did not match the prices of luxury restaurants.
Kafros Pizzeria,,Omer Kaya,,I think it's a nice place. Pizza was also nice; but a little expensive. I liked their sauce.
Kafros Pizzeria,,Burcu Tosun,,First of all; the atmosphere is nice; but there should be a solution for flies in the open air; such as fans that blow water. As for the pizza; although the view is beautiful; neither my wife and I did not like the pizza; unfortunately; the sauces that came only to pour on the pizza were good.
Kafros Pizzeria,,Hanife Topaloglu,,You should definitely go once and eat pizza. But I don't know if it happened to us; but the faces of the employees were never smiling and they were not caring.
Kafros Pizzeria,,Serafettin Otag,,We did pizza experience after a long road. As a place; it is very nice; pizzas are delicious; but we can say that the prices are a bit expensive.
Kafros Pizzeria,,Burak Bulutoglu,,Amazing pizzas omg!
Kafros Pizzeria,,Ferhat Gorur,,The place is spacious; clean. Pizza dough is thin. You had the chance to try 6 types of pizza; I can say that the best is the model with spinach and smoked turkey.
Kafros Pizzeria,,Ismail Gunes,,"The dough is very crispy and the most successful part is definitely the dough. And the dough was waiting overnight. Also, there is a 2-3 hour queue; so crowded."
Kebabci Halil Usta,,Hakan Saglicak,,The flavors are number 10. A little expensive; it may be too much for people with a medium budget.
Kebabci Halil Usta,,Ali Okan,,I ate küşleme; simit kebab; mixed cubes. The frosting was juicy and pretty good.
Kebabci Halil Usta,,Hatice Saral,,Meats are tasty without fat; but not very suitable for me. Since I like the meat cooked more; I couldn't enjoy it much anyway; I couldn't finish what I ordered. Although the portions are small; the prices are quite expensive.
Kebabci Halil Usta,,Duygu Memis,,I think the place is overrated. We said mixed in the middle; it was a disgusting image. Simit kebab was good. But the prices were too high.
Kebabci Halil Usta,,Sayan Badem,,Delicious but not overdone.
Kebabci Halil Usta,,Mert Sevimli,,Expensive.
Kebabci Halil Usta,,Sabri Donmez,,Deserts was amazing; especially baklava! Liked it.

Kebabci Halil Usta,,Onder Sonmez,,4 people mixed menu with their own salad; 750 TL. For those who say price is not a problem. Meat tastes excellent. There is a parking lot.
Kebabci Halil Usta,,Jale Serin,,We ate küşleme; it was amazing. But as you can see; really really expensive.
Kebabci Halil Usta,,Olcay Seker,,We came from out of the town to try their meat. We waited in line for a while; but that's okay. It was an amazing experience. I recommend it to everyone.
Abidin Tantuni,,Ugurcan Arbaz,,It was too oily and the place had problems with cleanliness.

Ahsap Iskender,,Burak Gurel,,We wanted to try this place as it is famous. We paid more than 800 liras for 2 people; 1.5 portions of Iskender and a drink.
Ahsap Iskender,,Kemal Batursoy,,Iskender kebab is not a meal worth that much money when I look at the price of 195 TL for 1 portion; rather than its taste.
Ahsap Iskender,,Bayram Duzgun,,Iskender is very delicious; you can optionally pour butter; what is interesting to me is that there are no treats.
Ahsap Iskender,,Ersin Kocabaldir,,The first time I ate; it's really worth the price. Taste and hygiene are the most important for me. Toilets were clean.

Ahsap Iskender,,Deniz Dilli,,There is no problem of waiting queue; the ambiance of the place is nice; well done.

Ahsap Iskender,,Suat Ozdogan,,Iskender kebab is a nice; clean and well-served place in Bursa.
Ahsap Iskender,,Omer Ata,,The interior is very well designed. It has a historical texture. Employees were engaged. Frankly; the taste of iskender was not overly good; it was normal.
Ahsap Iskender,,Kubra Unver,,It was delicious as I heard.
Ahsap Iskender,,Faruk Colak,,Expensive; poor presentation; taste was not good enough to come from out of town and try. There are no treats.

Pizzeria Remo,,Maria Pezzotti,,The pizzeria in the heart of Testaccio is open from 19:00 without reservation... fills up immediately. Excellent typical Roman pizza.

Pizzeria Remo,,Anthony Ciazzo,,Best pizza around. GOAT status. Have to try that Diavola pizza. Absolutely no cap!
Diyarbakir Ocakbasi Palace,,Nur Kirazli,,The food is quite delicious. The prices are higher than the average in Samsun; but suitable for a decent place. The waiters were interested; the appetizers were delicious.
Diyarbakir Ocakbasi Palace,,Can Batdal,,Diyarbakır Ocakbasi is one of the most established places of Samsun; but I couldn't understand this branch. The taste of the food is very good; there is no problem about it; but the service is very heavy; the number of staff is insufficient.
Diyarbakir Ocakbasi Palace,,Hatice Nayir,,The view is beautiful; the food is good. It's about the waiters. If you are going alone in the evening; a reservation seems to be a must. Too crowded.

Diyarbakir Ocakbasi Palace,,Mucait Celik,,I gave unnecessary money. It had no taste; no service. It was very expensive.

Diyarbakir Ocakbasi Palace,,Burcu Bayrakci,,Their meat was incredibly bad. Chicken canada had another taste.  The service is nice; but I would say the flavor is 0. In a cooker; this tastelessness is surprising; obviously.
Kaliteci,,Beril Sahin,,It's nice that it's open every time in a day. Turkish coffee + tea + 2 pastries =52TL. Service is average... Turkish coffee is not tasty.
Kaliteci,,Ahmet Batur,,Delicious tastes; clean place.

KFC,,Yusuf Kirma,,Very very bad food and very bad service 0/10.

KFC,,Fatma Zullu,,"The place is very nice; I think, the food was fresh and good; one of my favorite places."

Kruvasan,,Sila Gezgin,,The place was crowded when we first went. We preferred chocolate croissants. It was fresh and beautiful.

Midyeci Ahmet,,Guhur Gursan,,The kokorec and sauced mussels of this branch next to the sea are quite good.

Midyeci Ahmet,,Turan Yazici,,Prices are a little bit high but tastes are nice.
Midyeci Ahmet,,Ahmet Aktas,,In a word; it is magnificent; this is the heart of mussels in Istanbul. Atom kokoreç must be tasted. The mussels with sauce are another good one..
Midyeci Ahmet,,Murat Yazicioglu,,Taste has deteriorated compared to the past. I guess it's because he's famous. I do not recommend; you can eat betters in other restourants.
Midyeci Ahmet,,Ayhan Unlu,,Magnificent view and legendary taste; and kokorec is also very good; I recommend it to everyone.

Kalkanoglu Pilav,,Hasan Gemicioglu,,A very authentic place; its roasted meat and bean on the rice is legendary… 1 portion is enough.. The taste of the compote they serve is indispensable…
Kalkanoglu Pilav,,Faruk Gor,,2 roasted meat on rice + a ayran and a compote; a total of :220 It was nice that it was better roasted than rice.
Kalkanoglu Pilav,,Omer Kucuk,,I tried it after the positive reviews. Its rice and compote are nice. However; there are places in the Black Sea where I ate better roast beef. It's not a place I can say you should try. Prices are reasonable. The place is nice; the service was good.

Monica Kitchen,,Sena Akcay,,This is a place we always go for peri peri burger and crispy ravioli. Thanks for the treats.
Monica Kitchen,,Emre Guney,,We ordered the Cream Croissant. The chocolate was bitter and too liquid; I think it would be better if Nutella was applied. It was not a dessert worth the price. (145₺). They also forgot the tea I ordered.
Monica Kitchen,,Murat Ozyurt,,It is much better decorated and the quality has been improved considerably. When you enter; a very pleasant cafe atmosphere and ambiance welcomes you. I recommend sitting close to the wood stove. We ordered breakfast and were satisfied. Toilets were very; very dirty.

Antakya Mutfagi,,Cagdas Karsan,,The service is fast; the employees know the region and the cuisine well. Their lahmacun is very small in portion; the size of a hazelnut lahmacun.

Koco Restaurant,,Arman Senci,,Be sure to ask for all prices in advance. You'd definitely get charged triple the price and these guys will try to scam you in all possible ways. Including overcharging the market price; charging you for double the weight of the fish & serving you a half the fillet and all the bones to charge you for all that.

Tavuk Dunyasi,,Yusuf Sezer,,Recommend.

Kumsal Lokantasi,,Bora Gungoren,,Nice salad; it was delicious.
Salih Usta,,Ilker Ekinci,,We randomly decided to stop by and have an ice cream; but we tasted the worst ice cream we've ever had in our lives here. I don't know if it was one of the flavors they used; but the products seemed to be out of date.
Salih Usta,,Hasan Erdem,,Have you ever seen a rainbow in these colors?! The 5-year-old boy would draw the umbrella more beautifully; which was said to be made of sugar dough. The cake doesn't even stand up straight. A birthday cake would only be so sloppy.

Salih Usta,,Emre Safak,,It is clean and hygiene rules have been followed. The products are daily and fresh.  It is very rich in diversity. Every product you are looking for is available. You can shop without thinking at all.
Salih Usta,,Yilmaz Yasar,,Don't order anything at home; they're sending a stale dessert.
Salih Usta,,Yeliz Kiziltoprak,,I didn't like the atmosphere or the decor either. The lower floor is in front of the highway. Trucks are passing by; you're eating pies. It's not nice and it's expensive. Oh; and there are a lot of beggars.

Salih Usta,,Furkan Yuksel,,You won't regret that the products taste very good; but I've never seen such a bad staff before; definitely don't sit down and drink tea and coffee; take the product and leave; that's the most logical thing.
Salih Usta,,Aysel Hasir,,it is a very nice place for high quality and special tastes; the employees and the owner are very interested and polite; we are going with love.

Red Dragon,,Enes Sert,,The ambiance of the place is nice but the food is not tasty. I don't think I will come again.

Red Dragon,,Tugce Atalay,,We ate 3 Bentos and 3 Mixed Noodles. We liked everything we ate; it was very tasty. The service was fast; but it was a bit expensive for your information.
Mado,,Tugay Kutlu,,One of the places in Samsun with the most beautiful view and menu. A place where you can enjoy your dessert and coffee to the full while enjoying the sea view in front.
Mado,,Zafer Caner,,First of all; the service is slow and very late; and there are no crowds. I ordered a bulk profiterole. The portion also had 4 balls the size of nuts; and the chocolate was also tasteless.
Mado,,Sumeyye Gulten,,Atakum Mado... What a need for another word... The taste;  quality of the products are ala. It is very nice that the service staff is kind; solution-oriented. Especially the sensitivity of the company official; it is very nice to be relevant.
Mado,,Melike Gulsen,,There is no need to tell Mado at length; it is a clean and beautiful place.  But there is no standard; kadayif burma with pistachios used to be so unique that I would like to eat it everyday. But now sometimes it was burnt; sometimes dry; sometimes uncooked.
Mado,,Ali Berk Kustul,,Well; it was very nice; the service was very fast and the prices are reasonable; I recommend delicious food.
Mado,,Deniz Ozbekturk,,I wanted a four-cheese ravioli. It's just that the sauce is nice. Unfortunately; it failed. All of the portions have adapted to the economy; they have shrunk.
Mado,,Cetin Atali,,My guest and I went for dessert;  we waited 10 minutes to get a menu; we placed orders; and we waited another 20 minutes. Of course; one person couldn't make it to the dozens of tables upstairs to work.
Mado,,Asuman Mutevellioglu,,It may be the most friendly service I have ever encountered in my life.  All the employees were very sweet; caring people. the drinks and food were very tasty and fresh. I will definitely come again.
Mado,,Engin Kapan,,Something strange came out of the ice cream; the teas are stale and boiled; and you have to say an order two or three times; I definitely don't recommend it; it's a pity for your money.

Mersinli Cigerci Apo,,Hayrullah Unal,,Although it is not as much as an urfa; it is the only place that can eat liver under samsun conditions. Appetizers can be improved. There should definitely be green mint next to the liver; arugula does not suit the liver.

Zarathustra was the first to see in the struggle between good and evil the true mover of everything, and the translation of morality into the language of metaphysics as a force, a reason, an end in itself is his work.

,Bakso cak Sodiq,,melina kissanh,"I never thought I’d travel to the frozen expanse of the Sakha Republic, Russia, and find myself face-to-beak with an angry chicken—but here we are.

Bakso Cak Sodik is, in many ways, exactly what you hope to stumble upon in the most unlikely of places: a warm, bustling little outpost serving up soul-soothing Indonesian meatball soup with a side of personality. The bakso was rich and hearty, the broth steaming and flavorful enough to melt the permafrost from your bones.

And then… came the chicken.

At first, it strutted around like a proud little mascot. Then, with a sudden burst of confidence (or territorial pride?), it made a beeline for me. What followed was a chaotic, laugh-filled dance around the gravel lot, ending with me ducking inside, breathless and grinning, as locals chuckled knowingly. Apparently, this feathered enforcer takes its job seriously.

Despite (or maybe because of) the avian ambush, I left with a full belly and a great story. The owners were kind, the food was exceptional, and the atmosphere? Unforgettable.

If you're ever in Sakha and craving a bowl of bakso—with a little extra excitement—don’t miss this place.

Here’s a video if you don’t believe me."
